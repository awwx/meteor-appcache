## Thank you

This project was made possible by the financial support of [Meteor
Development
Group](http://meteor.com/).

[Jonathan Kingston](https://github.com/jonathanKingston) took the
[first stab](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/20)
at creating an app cache manifest.

[Nick Martin](https://github.com/n1mmy) figured out how to use the
"fallback" section to include the "cache busting" hash in static asset
URLs, so that the hash doesn't need to be added manually by the
developer.

[Nick Martin](https://github.com/n1mmy),
[Geoff Schmidt](https://github.com/gschmidt),
and
[Morten N.O. NÃ¸rgaard Henriksen](https://github.com/raix)
contributed design input, code review, and bug reports.

Thank you everyone!
